DataFrame Summary
The summary DataFrame shows that the Rural Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver is significantly higher than that of the Suburban and Urban city types. This can be contributed to the Total Drivers being significantly less than that of the Suburban and Urban city types. Cause and effect would suggest less Total Drivers would result in less Total Rides. While, supply and demand would suggest less Total Drivers would result to higher Average Fare per Driver.

Muliple line graph 
The multiple line graph tells us about the fares for each city type over time. Urban city types have the maximum fares. Suburban cities have the median fares. While, Urban city types have the minimum. Although, all three have these different levels of fares, all three have a correlating trend through out the months.
